# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

Looking at the dataframe below you will notice that we see higher weekly fare amounts for Urban cites. Rural cities report the lowest weekly fare amounts.

Looking at the `PyBer_fare_summary` line graph below, you'll notice that urban cites are, again, reporting the highest Fare amounts in USD. But, if we take a closer look at the trends, we can conclude that during the end of February and leading into March, we see a signigficant spike in Fare amounts amongst either city type.

## Summary

Three business recommendations I would recommend to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:

  1. Understand their target audience, as for knowing the audience, whether it is rural, suburban or urban, will help determine the likelieness citizens will use PyBer. Areas with higher drving rates will be the key audience to address.
  2. Use the data on fare rates to create a affordable price range for PyBer. Giving a less expensive options to citizens will be good for business.
  3. Understand why we see a signigficant spike in Fare amounts amongst either city type, during end of February and leading into March. This could be useful when thinking of having "Flash sales" or something of that nature.
